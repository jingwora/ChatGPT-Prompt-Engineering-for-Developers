However, I did notice that one of the ears is a bit lower than the other, which I don't think was designed to be asymmetrical. But that doesn't take away from its cuteness.\n\nThe only downside is that it's a bit small for the price I paid. I think there might be other options that are bigger for the same price. But overall, I'm happy with my purchase.\n\nOne thing that surprised me was that it arrived a day earlier than expected. This gave me the chance to play with it myself before giving it to my daughter. And I have to say, I was impressed with the quality and attention to detail.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a soft and cute panda plushie for yourself or a loved one, this is definitely a great option.
